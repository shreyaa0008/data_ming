Predictive Maintenance Using LSTM

A complete end-to-end Predictive Maintenance system that processes industrial sensor data and predicts potential machine failure. The project includes data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, sequence preparation, LSTM model training, and performance visualization.

Features

Automatic CSV detection and loading

Data cleaning and missing value handling

Exploratory Data Analysis (line plots, distributions, rolling stats)

Feature engineering (rolling means and derived signals)

Time-series sequence generation

LSTM-based failure prediction model

Model saving (best model + scaler)

Training performance metrics and plots
